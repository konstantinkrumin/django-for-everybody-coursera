### django-for-everybody-coursera

This is a repository for [Django for Everybody course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/django?) on Coursera.

Here you can find all necessary final solutions for the assignments for courses 2-4, including the final AdList assignment.

P.S. I did not include the following files to the repository for the reason that they are containing secret keys:
- mysite/mysite/settings.py
- mysite/mysite/github_settings.py
- batch/batch/settings.py

However, you can copy and modify them following the instructions in the course.

You can also check a final version of the course project [here](https://konstantink1.pythonanywhere.com/)

To test functionality you can use the following:
- **LOGIN: test**
- **PASSWORD: Qwerty78***
